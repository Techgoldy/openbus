#Openbus


An open source framework for centralized logging and event management (batch and realtime).

Openbus is currently splitted in the following subprojects:

 -  [openbus-broker](./openbus-broker): Messaging layer. based on [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).
 -  [openbus-batch](./openbus-batch): Batch processes for ingestion and analysis. Based on [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and related technologies.
 -  [openbus-realtime](./openbus-realtime): Real time consumptiom and analysis of events. Based on [Storm] (http://storm-project.net/).

##Use Cases

Some use cases where openbus could be applied are:

  - Web analytics
  - Social Network Analysis
  - Security Information and Event Management
