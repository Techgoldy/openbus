Openbus
=======

A Produban initiative for the development of a common infraestructure to store, analyze and visualize log events, both in real-time and batch.

Currently openbus has the following subprojects:

 -  [openbus-broker](./openbus-broker): event producers, consumers and serializers.
 -  [openbus-batch](./openbus-batch): Hadoop stuff, Pig and Hive scripts, custom UDFs.

Soon we expect to add more subprojects such as `openbus-realtime`, `openbus-search` and `openbus-viz`.
